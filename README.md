This project had been developped in several architectures. Each architecture is present in a separate Git Branch and is completely independent from the others  :

- Pull Architecture (Branch : arch/pull)
- Advanced Pull Architecture (Branch : arch/advanced_pull)
- Push Architecture (Java Regular Eclipse Project) (Branch : arch/push)
- Push Architecture (Maven Java Project + Unit Tests) (Branch : maven_arch/push)

("Master" branch is a first pull version and is not useful, please look for the architecture you want in the dedicated branch).
